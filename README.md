## haskellbook

This repository follows my progress reading [The Haskell Book](http://www.haskellbook.com/).
I'm starting with a folder per chapter. Each will have notes I take while reading,
as well as my solutions to the exercises (sometimes in the notes, sometimes .hs files).

I'm reading the book in conjunction with
[a Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Charlottesville-Haskell-Book-Reading-Group/).
