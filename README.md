## haskellbook

This repository follows my progress reading [The Haskell Book](http://www.haskellbook.com/).
I'm starting with a folder per chapter. Each will have notes I take while reading,
as well as my solutions to the exercises (sometimes in the notes, sometimes .hs files).
I'm also including [notes](meetups) from the
[Charlottesville meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Charlottesville-Haskell-Book-Reading-Group/)
to read this book.

Chapters:
1. [Chapter 1](ch1): All You Need is Lambda
2. [Chapter 2](ch2): Hello, Haskell!
